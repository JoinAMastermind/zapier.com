\\ Purpose:
\\ Find a record in Airtable from zapier which matches two criteria

\\ Where:
\\ In Zapier.com
\\ Integrating with airtable.com
\\ Using Find Record
\\ Select your "Base" and your "Table"
\\ You are able to run a search using the field "Search Formula" 


\\ My original that works is: AND({column1_name} = '{{variable1?}}', {column2_name} = '{{variable2?}}')



\\ To do:
\\ Replace [column1_name] and [column2_name]
\\ Replace [variable1] and [variable2]

\\ The code:
AND({[column1_name]} = '{{[variable1]?}}', {[column2_name]} = '{{[variable2]?}}')
